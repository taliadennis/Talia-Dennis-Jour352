      <div id="title"> Student & Copy Editor </div>

      <p class="top"> I am a student working toward degrees in multiplatform journalism and social and cultural history. I have written published articles, which include features, news stories, events, reviews and opinions. Currently, I am focusing on copy editing where I am able to employ my research skills. My journalism experience extends to working at various student publications. </p>

              <p class="description">I copy edit articles for the student newspaper twice a week and work in four-hour shifts. On my first day, I caught a sentence in a review that resembled one published in The Washington Post. </p>

          <div id="organization"> The Writer’s Bloc </div>
            <div id="date"> September 2016 to present </div>

              <p class="description">I began as a freelance reporter for the University of Maryland’s online publication for the arts during my freshman year. As a sophomore, I began copy editing while producing clips for my profile. Recently, I have prioritized my copy editing position and will help the managing editor publish and finalize edits of articles.</p>

        <div id="jobtitle"> Orientation Leader </div>
          <div id="organization"> Education Abroad </div>
            <div id="date"> January 2019 </div>

              <p class="description">I helped international exchange students get accustomed to student-life in the United States and at the University of Maryland. I worked with other leaders to give a presentation on dining on and around the campus. When students had questions I did my best to answer them accurately and honestly. If I did not have the answer, I either asked someone who would know or directed them to another source or individual.</p>

        <div id="jobtitle"> Intern </div>
          <div id="jobtitle"> University of Maryland Archives </div>
            <div id="date"> November 2018 </div>

              <p class="description"> I participated in the Intern-for-a-Day program at the University of Maryland where I learned about the archival process. I helped organized a list of guests and their contact information for an upcoming event and refiled some old documents to an upgraded preservation system.</p>

      <div id="jobtitle"> Committee Member </div>
        <div id="organization"> Academic Affairs </div>
          <div id="date"> September 2017 to May 2018 </div>

            <p class="description">I served on the Academic Affairs Committee for the Alpha Lambda Delta & Phi Eta Sigma Honor Society chapter at the University of Maryland. My responsibilities included reading students’ scholarship applications and ranking aspects of them to help determine who would receive the funds. It was strictly objective and based only on the information provided.</p>

      <div id="jobtitle"> Server </div>
        <div id="organization"> Sunrise Grill </div>
          <div id="date"> May 2014 to January 2019 </div>

            <p class="description">I am a seasonal employee at a local restaurant in my town. I began working as a busser when I was 16 and was promoted to a server when I was 17. It was strengthened my abilities to multitask, work quickly and efficiently, problem-solve and provide instructions and information with clarity. I strive for accuracy to ensure my customers get exactly what they order.</p>
